# CDCL Buddy

CDCL Buddy is an interactive educational tool designed to demystify Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) SAT solvers. It provides a hands-on learning experience through dynamic visualizations, drag-and-drop interactivity, and real-time solver feedback. The app is aimed at students and educators seeking an intuitive way to explore SAT-solving techniques.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: View and manipulate implication graphs dynamically.
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Experiment with variable assignments to understand heuristics and their impact.
- **Custom CDCL Solver**: Features conflict detection, clause learning, and non-chronological backtracking implemented in JavaScript.
- **Tutorial Module**: Offers explanations of key concepts like conflict resolution, learned clauses, and decision heuristics.
- **Multi-Platform Access**: Available as a web app and mobile app on iOS and Android.

## Installation

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/toluooshy/cdcl-buddy.git
   cd cdcl-buddy
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:

   ```

### Mobile App

- Download from:
  - [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cdcl-buddy/id6738808478)
  - [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cdclbuddy.cdclbuddy)

## Usage

### Input Format

Enter a SAT problem in **CNF format** (e.g., `(A, B)(-A, C)(-B, -C)`) in the input box. Use the interactive graph to explore variable assignments and observe real-time solver updates.

### Key Components

- **Graph Visualization**: Nodes represent variables or decisions, while edges illustrate implications and conflicts.
- **Conflict Modal**: Highlights conflicts and provides options to add learned clauses using heuristics like First UIP or negation.
- **Tutorial Module**: Explains CDCL processes in a step-by-step manner for self-guided learning.

## Development Overview

### Frameworks and Libraries

- **React**: Front-end framework for interactive UI.
- **React Flow**: Dynamic graph rendering and manipulation.
- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile app support. For the React Native-specific repository, see [here](https://github.com/toluooshy/cdcl-buddy-app).

### Core Logic

The CDCL solver handles:

- **Conflict Detection**: Identifies and resolves conflicts in the clause set.
- **Clause Learning**: Adds learned clauses based on heuristics (e.g., First UIP).
- **Backtracking**: Implements non-chronological backtracking to improve efficiency.
